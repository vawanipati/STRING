Certainly, here's a write-up addressing the risk overlays regarding the patent submission and presentation for your OKRs:

"I'd like to acknowledge that there are two aspects of my OKRs that are currently in progress but have not been completed as of now. The first is the pending patent submission, and the second is the absence of presentations related to my objectives.

I want to assure you that I am actively working on both of these tasks and I am committed to ensuring their completion before the end of this year. The patent submission is a priority, and I am dedicated to finalizing this important process. Additionally, I am diligently preparing presentations that align with my OKRs and will deliver them in due time.

These are essential components of my objectives, and I am determined to fulfill them to meet the established goals. I appreciate your understanding and support as I work towards the successful accomplishment of these critical milestones."
